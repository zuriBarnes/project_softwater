## Overview

I often get content requests from my youth sports clients. Most of the requests are adding text or images to existing posts.

### Problem

Can I create an application that uses the folllowing models?
Can I develop a website to display the data in a dynamic way?
Can I use this app in my relance business?

The app will have a simple form for registered users to post data. Then instead of sending emails, users can update the data themselves.

### Models

- Leader
- Coach
- Team
- Manager
- Tournament
- Event
- Page
- Post

### Users

Club staff and Software Admins

Club staff will need to be registered to access and upload data.

Dashboard access is reserved for Software Admins only.

### Benefits

- This app will save me time
- The app with be scalable
- Possible business use

### Tech Stack

#### Front End

- Django Template Engine

#### Back End

- Django ORM
